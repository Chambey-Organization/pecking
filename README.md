# Pecklin
### The segue into the world of computer science 

An open-source command line tool for practicing touch typing and programming, supported and developed by [Chambey](https://chambey.org/about/ "The Public Interest Technology Company") and open-source contributors.

#### Hunting & Pecklin
Pecklin is derived from an idea meant to reduce the hunt and peck method of typing while learning to code.


### Peck + ~Kotlin~ = Pecklin

Although the origins of Pecklin stem from a pet project created for learning [The Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org/), we have switched to primarily focus on using Go for the short term. We are looking forward to experimenting with the Charm libraries.

Our knowledge base will span to other languages as the project matures. 

### Goals of Pecklin

Pecklin intends to:

* Be a noob-friendly entry into the world software development and beyond
	- Hand holding tutorials

* Increase keyboard literacy from the perspective of a software developer
	- Provide WPM and accuracy statistics
* Cultivate understanding and practice language syntax
	- Target and review pre-existing source code for practice

### Project Status: A Computer Science Experiment

The Pecklin project is in itsâ€™ early stage of developing a minimum viable product and looks to be similar to, and perhaps extends from:

[GNU Typist](https://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/) - (also called gtypist) is a universal typing tutor. You can learn correct typing and improve your skills by practicing its exercises on a regular basis.

[Mltype](https://mltype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Command line tool for improving typing speed and accuracy. The main goal is to help programmers practice programming languages.

[Typing.io](https://typing.io/) - Typing Practice for Programmers

[Charm](https://charm.sh/) - We build tools to make the command line glamorous.
