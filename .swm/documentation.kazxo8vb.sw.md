Initialize the database. We use GORM since it reduces boilerplate code. Create database named pecklin. You can access the file named pecklin.db on the root directory
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ database/initializeDatabase.go
```go
12     	var err error
13     	DB, err = gorm.Open("sqlite3", "pecklin.db")
14     	if err != nil {
15     		panic("Failed to connect to database")
16     	}
```

<br/>

create the lesson table from the models if it't exist
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ database/initializeDatabase.go
```go
19     	DB.AutoMigrate(&models.Lesson{})
```

<br/>

initialize the database. Helps us create the tables if they do not exist. It also creates a database connection to our local database
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
19     	database.InitializeDatabase()
```

<br/>

Read the completed lessons and store them in the completed lessons variable
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
21     	lessons := database.ReadCompletedLesson()
```

<br/>

These are all the lessons regardless of their completion status. Store them i allLessons variable
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
22     	allLessons := database.ReadAllLessons()
```

<br/>

Clear the screen so that the user can focus on the lesson
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
28     	clear.ClearScreen()
```

<br/>

Read the lessons in the lessons folder and if the lesson is incomplete, the user can start typing it. The lessons are displayed to the user in the same order as they are in the lessons folder
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
24     	err := ReadTextLessons(lessons, allLessons, &exitErr)
```

<br/>

After completing the lessons without exiting, the user is given another menu to either redo, see the completed lessons stats or exit the typing practice.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
29     	fmt.Println("\n Congratulations! You have completed all the lessons \n \nPress RETURN to redo the typing practice, SPACE to view lesson stats and ESC to quit")
30     	if err := keyboard.Open(); err != nil {
31     		panic(err)
32     	}
33     	defer func() {
34     		_ = keyboard.Close()
35     	}()
36     
37     	for {
38     		_, key, err := keyboard.GetKey()
39     		if err != nil {
40     			break
41     		}
```

<br/>

On pressing ENTER, the user is able to redo the lessons. here we set the status of all lessons as incomplete and the user starts from lesson one
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
43     		if key == keyboard.KeyEnter {
44     			err := keyboard.Close()
45     			if err != nil {
46     				break
47     			}
48     			database.RedoLessons()
49     			lessons = database.ReadCompletedLesson()
50     
51     			err = ReadTextLessons(lessons, allLessons, &exitErr)
52     			if exitErr {
53     				return
54     			}
55     			if err != nil {
56     				return
57     			}
58     		}
59     
```

<br/>

If the user presses SPACE on the keyboard, we read the lessons and display them on this for loop. typing speed is shown as the best speed on that lesson
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
60     		if key == keyboard.KeySpace {
61     			for _, lesson := range allLessons {
62     				fmt.Printf("\nLesson Title: %s\n", lesson.Title)
63     				fmt.Printf("Typing Speed: %.2f WPM\n", lesson.BestSpeed)
64     				fmt.Println("---------------------------------")
65     			}
66     		}
```

<br/>

On ESC, break the loop which exits the whole typing lesson
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
67     		if key == keyboard.KeyEsc {
68     			break
69     		}
```

<br/>

This is a variable which is passed as a pointer to other functions and it tracks if the user exits the typing practice at any point
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
20     	var exitErr bool
```

<br/>

Define the root folder containing the lessons in the .txt format
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
78     	root := "lessons"
```

<br/>

Read the lessons data as contained in the root folder. This will loop all files in the provided folder
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
80     	return filepath.Walk(root, func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
81     		if err != nil {
```

<br/>

We are only interested in files which are not directories. return nil if the file is a directory
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
87     		if !info.IsDir() {
```

<br/>

Extract the file name without extension in order to use it as the lesson title which will make the naming consistent throughout the code
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
88     			fileNameWithoutExt := strings.TrimSuffix(info.Name(), filepath.Ext(info.Name()))
89     
```

<br/>

Skip the lesson if it is complete
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
90     			if lessonComplete(fileNameWithoutExt, lessons) {
91     				return nil
92     			}
```

<br/>

If the lesson is not complete, read the file content and store the sentences in the fileContent variable
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
93     			fileContent, err := readLinesFromFile(path)
```

<br/>

Create the lesson data which is a struct that holds out data, lesson name and the content which is a list of sentences in the file
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
98     			lessonData := models.Lesson{
99     				Title:   fileNameWithoutExt,
100    				Content: fileContent,
101    			}
```

<br/>

Redirect user to the welcome screen of the lesson, pass the lesson data and has exited pointer to notify us if the user exits the lesson
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
103    			welcome.WelcomeScreen(&lessonData, &hasExitedLesson)
```

<br/>

If the user exits the lesson return an error which will trigger the end of the typing practice. Else delay the next lesson by 3 seconds so that the user to read his stats for the completed lesson
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
106    			if hasExitedLesson {
107    				*exitErr = true
108    				return errors.New("user exited the lesson")
109    			} else {
110    				time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
111    			}
```

<br/>

Go through the completed lessons and see if the lesson is complete. if complete return true. else false. helps in skipping the complete lessons
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
118    func lessonComplete(lessonTitle string, lessons []models.Lesson) bool {
119    	for _, lesson := range lessons {
120    		if lesson.Title == lessonTitle {
121    			return true
122    		}
123    	}
124    	return false
125    }
```

<br/>

Use scanner to read the sentences in the provided file and return a slice of sentences contained in the file, if an error is encountered while reading, return the error too.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ main.go
```go
127    func readLinesFromFile(filePath string) ([]string, error) {
128    	file, err := os.Open(filePath)
129    	if err != nil {
130    		return nil, err
131    	}
132    	defer file.Close()
133    
134    	var lines []string
135    	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
136    	for scanner.Scan() {
137    		lines = append(lines, scanner.Text())
138    	}
139    	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
140    		return nil, err
141    	}
142    	return lines, nil
143    }
```
